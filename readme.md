### gradle-macappbundle-plugin [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/cr0/gradle-plugins/gradle-macappbundle-plugin/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/cr0/gradle-plugins/gradle-macappbundle-plugin/_latestVersion)

Create OS X application bundles from Java projects using gradle. A JRE can optionally be included.

#### It's not my work, though...

This is a fork of [gradle-macappbundle](https://code.google.com/p/gradle-macappbundle) by @crotwell. However, it differs in a few things:

* Instead of providing two binary stubs (for Apple Java and Oracle Java) this version uses infinitekind's extended `JavaAppLauncher` which is available at [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/infinitekind/appbundler/).
* **Now it's also possible to extend the classpath!** Oracle's version did not allow altering the classpath, in fact it always used the default `Java` folder within an app bundle. Using the new `JVMClassPath` property in `Info.plist` the classpath can include either single `jar`s or whole folders when the wildcard `*` is used. Of course, the contents of the `Java` folder within the bundle are also included.
* Support for Apple Java has been removed since Apple stopped the development and recommends using Oracle's version.

#### How to use

First, you need to include the `macappbundle` plugin using the following fancy gradle 2.1+ syntax. The plugin is/should be available at `jcenter`.

```
plugins {
  id "com.github.cr0.macappbundle" version "3.0.0"
}
```

Please have a look at [bintray](https://bintray.com/cr0/gradle-plugins/gradle-macappbundle-plugin) for more details.

The following example shows a working configuration including the extendable classpath feature.

```
macAppBundle {
	appName = "Foo App"
	appCategory = "public.app-category.utilities"
	icon = "gradle/icon/fooapp.icns"
	agent = true

	version = "0.1.3-alpha+SNAPSHOT.123456789"
	shortVersion = "0.1.3a (nightly)"

	mainClassName = "org.foo.app.Launcher"

	bundleJRE = false
	bundleExecutable = "FooApp"
	bundleIdentifier = "org.foo.app"
	bundleCopyright = "Copyright 2015 Foo App"

	bundleExtras.put("NSHighResolutionCapable", "true")

	javaProperties.put("file.encoding", "utf-8")
	javaXProperties.add("mx2048M")
	javaXProperties.add("startOnFirstThread")

	javaClassPath.add("/Users/\$CURRENT_USER/.config/fooapp/plugins/*")

	archiveName = "Foo App ${pluginVersion}"
}
```
There are a few other options available -- if you're interested have a look at the [source code](https://github.com/cr0/gradle-macappbundle-plugin/blob/master/src/main/groovy/com/github/cr0/gradle/macAppBundle/MacAppBundlePluginExtension.groovy).

If you use `createApp`, the plugin creates an app named `Foo App.app` in the `build/macApp` (settable using `archiveOutputDir`) directory.

You can also package the app as either a ZIP file (`createAppZip`) or a DMG with an optional background image (`createDmg`; applicable only on OS X).

##### A note on external cps

3.0.1 allows external class paths, i.e. all paths which are not in the app bundle, are optional. This is needed since many apps use external class path directories for e.g. plugins. Hence, such directories do not exist at first launch.

#### Where is 1.0.0 and 2.0.0?
Since this is a fork of crotwell's version which already was 2.0.0 I decided to bump the version again.
